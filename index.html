      <p>San Joaquin Valley townhall is a non-profit organization that is run by
         an all volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally
          and internationally renowned, thought provoking speakers who inform,
           educate, and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:

      <blockquote> 
        &ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members..
        I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;
